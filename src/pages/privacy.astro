        Under GDPR Art. 6(1)(f), processing is lawful where it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate
        interests pursued by the controller, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental
        rights and freedoms of the data subject. The legal basis for processing your personal data is our legitimate
        interest to operate our business for the benefit of our clients, job seekers, service providers, employees and
        shareholders.
